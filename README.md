## What is it?

It is a test of "dismemberment" technology as used in left 4 dead 2 and a few other titles. The shader punches through a hole in the model via alpha testing.
To use, open the project, open "DemoScene", press "Play" and click the ragdoll to shoot.

Currently this project is in a messy state, and is not complete. Right now it is not possible to split ragdoll in two, have limbs fly off and such.
It may be updated in future.
